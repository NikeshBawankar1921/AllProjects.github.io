                    <h2>Line Maze Solver</h2>
                    <p>A Line Maze Solver is a program designed to autonomously navigate through a maze composed of
                        lines and open spaces. Using algorithms like depth-first search or breadth-first search, it
                        efficiently determines the optimal path by following the lines from the maze's start to its end.
                        The solver provides a sequence of movements or directions, demonstrating its ability to navigate
                        through the maze intelligently.</p>

            <h3>Hello! I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech in Electronics Engineering at Yeshwantrao Chavan College of
                Engineering, Nagpur, after completing my diploma in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from
                Government Polytechnic, Nagpur. I'm passionate about working on both hardware and software projects,
                some of which you can explore in this portfolio. Beyond academics, I enjoy playing Sudoku, creating
                projects, and spending quality time with friends. As the Training and Placement Coordinator for my
                department, I actively engage in various competitions and recently secured the second prize at the
                Bhopal Zonal Techfest organized by IIT Bombay in the event "Meshmerize".</h3>
